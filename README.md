Streaming Data Types
===================


This repository contains the flatbuffer structure definition files for messages streamed through Kafka through the ESS data acquisition  system. As this repository essentially contains the interface definitions which make the ESS data aquistion tick, be extra careful when changing anything in here. Please consult any affected parties. Develop in branches.
